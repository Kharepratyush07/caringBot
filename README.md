# CaringBot
A bot is a voice controlled wheel chair prototype for disabled people. We built this bot with many features like voice controlled using speech
recognition module, if a person fall from the wheelchair it will automatically call and send an alert message with live location to its one of the family
members. For calling and messaging purpose we use Sim800L module and for live location we use Neo-6M gps module. Also adding a calling feature,
the person can call and controlled the wheelchair with the help of camera module.

**USE HEADPHONE FOR CLEAR SOUND**
